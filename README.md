# Random-Game-Launcher

The build.7z archive contains everything you need to run this.  
You have to copy the path to [game].exe, NOT just the folder it's in.  
games.txt MUST be in the SAME FOLDER as play_a_game.exe/.py


This is a python script to launch a random game from the list in "games.txt"  


The zip file contains an executable that does the same thing as the script,  
but it works on computers without python. Unzip it with 7zip, and run the  
executable to launch a random game from within games.txt  

Edit games.txt to contain the filepath to the executable of all the games  
you want to launch, one filepath per line.  games.txt must be in the same  
directory as either the executable or the python script, whichever you're using
